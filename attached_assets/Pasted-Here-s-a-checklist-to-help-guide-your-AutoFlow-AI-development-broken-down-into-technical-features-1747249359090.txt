Here‚Äôs a checklist to help guide your AutoFlow AI development, broken down into **technical features**, **user experience**, and **business validation**. Each section includes milestones and questions you should be able to confidently answer:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. CORE TECHNICAL FEATURES

### **üîí Backend & Security**

* [ ] User authentication implemented (OAuth, Magic link, etc.)
* [ ] JWT or session-based access tokens secured
* [ ] Role-based access control (e.g., free vs. pro users)
* [ ] Rate limiting, input validation, and basic abuse protection
* [ ] Secrets and credentials are stored securely (e.g., environment variables, encrypted vaults)

**You should be able to answer:**

* How do you verify a user is authenticated?
* Where are tokens/secrets stored and how are they accessed?

---

### **üß† AI Prompt Parsing + Intent Understanding**

* [ ] Natural language is reliably parsed into structured steps
* [ ] Mindmap input (if supported) converts into logical steps
* [ ] Multiple workflows tested and output matches expected schema
* [ ] You have a modular prompt engineering layer (system, user, examples)

**You should be able to answer:**

* How does GPT output get mapped to nodes/tools?
* How do you handle ambiguity or invalid prompts?

---

### **‚öôÔ∏è Workflow Engine & Tool Integration**

* [ ] Actions/steps are represented in a structured schema
* [ ] n8n or Make.com workflows are generated with valid JSON
* [ ] Workflow schema includes tool ID, input/output mapping, order
* [ ] You can execute or export these workflows (test at least 3 use cases)

**You should be able to answer:**

* How do you handle step chaining, looping, branching?
* What happens when a step fails or returns unexpected data?

---

## ‚úÖ 2. USER EXPERIENCE FLOW

### **üñ• Frontend - Component Driven UI**

* [ ] Frontend built using React (or similar) with reusable components
* [ ] Drag-and-drop or editable flowchart UI (if building custom visual editor)
* [ ] Input forms for natural language or mindmap uploads
* [ ] AI-generated results shown in editable UI
* [ ] "Export to n8n" or "Run this flow" option

**You should be able to answer:**

* How does the user go from an idea to an editable workflow?
* How much of the workflow is editable by hand?

---

### **üß™ Testing & Reliability**

* [ ] Frontend components have basic tests (unit/UI)
* [ ] GPT inputs and outputs are logged for quality review
* [ ] You have validation logic for AI-generated outputs
* [ ] At least 5 end-to-end flows tested with different inputs

**You should be able to answer:**

* What‚Äôs the fallback if GPT output is invalid or empty?
* How do you test that a workflow is valid before running it?

---

## ‚úÖ 3. BUSINESS & USER VALIDATION

### **üìà Onboarding & User Flow**

* [ ] Landing page exists with clear value prop
* [ ] Demo video or use case walkthrough is available
* [ ] First-time experience is smooth (1-2 steps to output)
* [ ] Tooltips, guides, or AI assistant available in-app

**You should be able to answer:**

* Who is your ideal user? (e.g., marketers, ops people, devs)
* How quickly can a new user get value from your product?

---

### **üíµ Monetization & Analytics**

* [ ] Stripe or payment system integrated (even if sandbox)
* [ ] Plans for tiered features (free vs paid)
* [ ] Basic analytics: most used features, common workflows
* [ ] Early users or test feedback logged

**You should be able to answer:**

* What feature(s) would users pay for?
* What are your activation and retention bottlenecks?

---

### **üîó Integrations & Extensibility**

* [ ] Custom tools/nodes can be added to workflow engine
* [ ] GPT knows about available tool schemas
* [ ] Option to import/export flows (JSON, n8n format, etc.)

**You should be able to answer:**

* How do you add support for a new third-party tool?
* Is there a plugin system for others to build on?
